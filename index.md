```
# Define a function to generate the Fibonacci sequence
def fibonacci(n):
  # Initialize the first two terms
  a = 0
  b = 1
  # Loop until the next term is smaller than n
  while a < n:
    # Print the current term
    print(a, end=" ")
    # Update the next two terms
    a, b = b, a + b
  # Print a new line
  print()

# Call the function with a given number
fibonacci(100)
```
